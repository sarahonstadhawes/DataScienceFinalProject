# DataScienceFinalProject

Final project -- Analyzing scrapped data from IMDB to create a model that uses linear models to predict the rank of movies, looking at simple linear regression and multiple linear regression models to find the best model to predict the rank of a movie based on the length (in minutes) of the movie, its starscore (scale of 1-10), its genre, and the rating of the movie.
